# Short description of this project
description: |-
  This `build-harness` is a collection of Makefiles to facilitate building Golang projects, Dockerfiles, Helm charts, and more.

# Introduction to the project
#introduction: |-
#  This is an introduction.

# How to use this project
usage: |-
  At the top of your `Makefile` add, the following...

  ```make
  -include $(shell curl -sSL -o .build-harness "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/russelltsherman/build-harness/main/templates/Makefile.build-harness"; echo .build-harness)
  ```

  This will download a `Makefile` called `.build-harness` and include it at run-time. We recommend adding the `.build-harness` file to your `.gitignore`.

  This automatically exposes many new targets that you can leverage throughout your build & CI/CD process.

  Run `make help` for a list of available targets.

  **NOTE:** the `/` is interchangable with the `:` in target names
